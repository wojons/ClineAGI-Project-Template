# Maintenance Notes for ClineAGI Master Memory Bank

This file contains notes and reminders for maintaining this master memory bank repository.

## Updating the Public Memory Bank Template

If baseline information, structures, or generally useful default content are developed within this master memory bank, remember to manually update the public `wojons/ClineAGI-MemoryBank-Template` repository.

This ensures new users benefit from core enhancements without inheriting personalized data.

**Process:**
1. Identify generic content in this master memory bank that should be in the public template.
2. Manually copy/adapt that content into your local clone of the `ClineAGI-MemoryBank-Template` repository (e.g., `ClineAGI/memory-bank-template-source/`).
3. Commit and push the changes in the `ClineAGI-MemoryBank-Template` repository.
