# Project Brief: ClineAGI

## 1. Project Name
ClineAGI

## 2. Project Goal
To collaboratively build an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by leveraging the interactive development capabilities of Cline (the AI assistant) and the user. The project aims to explore the "chicken and the egg" problem of using an AI to build a more advanced AI.

## 3. Core Concept
ClineAGI will function as a core "operating system" or foundational layer for AGI development. Its development will be driven by direct interaction between the user and Cline. The system is designed to be modular, allowing for:
-   **Core AGI Development:** The main `ClineAGI` repository will house the core functionalities and intelligence, developed iteratively.
-   **User-Specific Projects:** A `projects` directory within `ClineAGI` will contain separate, individually version-controlled repositories. These repositories will store user-specific data, preferences, or distinct AGI-related sub-projects, allowing users to customize and extend their AGI instance without affecting the core or being broken by core updates.

## 4. Key Challenges
-   **The "Chicken and the Egg" Problem:** Using the current AI (Cline) to design and build a more sophisticated AGI.
-   **Modularity and Scalability:** Ensuring the core AGI can be updated and expanded without disrupting individual user projects.
-   **Knowledge Management:** Effectively capturing and utilizing the evolving understanding and design of the AGI within Cline's session-based memory, primarily through a robust Memory Bank.

## 5. Success Metrics (Initial)
-   Successful establishment of the core `ClineAGI` repository structure and Memory Bank.
-   Ability to create and manage separate project repositories within the `projects` directory.
-   Demonstrable progress in defining and implementing core AGI functionalities through user-Cline collaboration.
-   Maintaining a comprehensive and up-to-date Memory Bank that accurately reflects the project's state and evolution.
