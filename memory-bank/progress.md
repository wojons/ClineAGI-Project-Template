# Progress: ClineAGI - `.clinerules` Refinement and Alignment

## 1. Current Status
-   **Phase:** `.clinerules` Refinement and Alignment (Batch 1: Core Rules).
-   **Overall Progress:** Began systematic review and update of `.clinerules` based on `cline-docs-context7.txt`. First batch of core rules (Memory Bank structure, continuous improvement, knowledge management, tool usage) processed.
-   **Merged Patterns:** Created and enhanced merged pattern files in `.clinerules/996_merged_patterns/` for Summarization, Analysis, Creation, Extraction, Visualization, Improvement/Refinement, and Utility/Helper Tasks. Renamed merged pattern files to follow the `NNN-MM_descriptive-name.md` standard. (Completed prior to this phase)

## 3. What's Left to Build (Immediate Scope)
1.  Finalize updates to this `progress.md` file. (In Progress)
2.  Propose and execute Git commit for the first batch of core rule changes and Memory Bank updates.
3.  Continue developing prompts for specific agent tasks (e.g., code generation, self-verification).
4.  Integrate the agent prompts and knowledge base into the ClineAGI operational loop.

## 4. Known Issues & Challenges
-   **File Editing Issues:** Encountered difficulties updating `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` previously. Will monitor tool performance.
-   **Integrating Agent Prompts:** Need to determine the best way to inject relevant knowledge base sections into agent prompts during execution.
-   **Managing Agent State:** Need to define how the agent's "CURRENT SELF-ASSESSMENT" state will be managed and updated iteratively.

## 5. Evolution of Project Decisions & Learnings
-   **Decision:** Analyze external AI prompts and research to inform AGI agent prompting and `.clinerules` improvements. (Implemented)
-   **Decision:** Organize agent knowledge base and prompts within `.clinerules/` as a prompt library. (Implemented)
-   **Decision:** Systematically review and align all `.clinerules` with `cline-docs-context7.txt`, deduplicating and archiving as necessary. (Completed for all directories)
-   **Learning:** External AI system prompts (like `cline-docs-context7.txt`) provide critical, specific guidance for tailoring internal rules.
-   **Learning:** A systematic, step-by-step approach (managed by `sequentialthinking`) is essential for complex refactoring tasks.
-   **Learning:** Clear archival procedures are important when deduplicating instructional content.
-   **Learning:** Regularly updating the Memory Bank is key to maintaining context during multi-step operations.
-   **Learning:** Encountered and worked around file editing issues, highlighting the need for robust fallback strategies and precise tool usage.
-   **Learning:** Analyzing CL4R1T4S prompts provided specific, actionable guidelines for improving communication, tool usage, coding practices, and more.
-   Detailing prompting style guidelines is important for supporting less capable models.
-   **Creating merged patterns helps to organize and synthesize the functionality of numerous individual patterns.**
-   Completed review of all `.clinerules` directories: `000_core`, `001_reference`, `002_workflow`, `003_protocol`, `004_tech-specific`, `005_coding_guidelines`, `996_merged_patterns`, `998_patterns`, and `999_prompt_styles`.
-   Identified and merged duplicate rules related to continuous improvement.
-   Consolidated communication, style, and tool usage guidelines into fewer, more comprehensive files.

## 6. Future Milestones (High-Level)
-   Completion of the full `.clinerules` review and refinement process.
-   First successful execution of the AGI agent's main loop using the created prompts and knowledge base.
-   Implementation of agent self-verification mechanisms.
-   Demonstration of the agent performing a simple self-modification.
