TaskRef: "Analyze CL4R1T4S prompts and improve .clinerules"

Learnings:
- Analyzed various AI system prompts (Anthropic, Bolt, Cursor, Devin, Hume, Lovable, Manus, Mistral, MultiOn, OpenAI, Perplexity, Replit, Vercel v0, Windsurf, XAI) to identify effective patterns and guidelines.
- Gained insights into different communication styles (empathetic, concise, adaptive, structured).
- Learned detailed approaches to tool usage, including combining actions, specific tool scenarios, and error handling.
- Explored structured planning methodologies (planning modes, working backwards, simulated Chain-of-Thought).
- Identified specific technical guidance for common web development technologies (Next.js/Supabase, Tailwind, Shadcn UI) and data security practices.
- Recognized patterns in structured output formats (research reports, code generation).

Difficulties:
- Initial attempt to write reflection log failed as the target file did not exist. This was resolved by creating the file.

Successes:
- Successfully listed and read all CL4R1T4S prompt files.
- Successfully used sequential thinking to analyze prompts and identify areas for improvement in .clinerules.
- Successfully updated core communication guidelines (`000_core/000-06_core-ai-communication-guidelines.md`).
- Successfully updated core tool usage guidelines (`000_core/000-07_core-ai-tool-usage-guidelines.md`).
- Successfully updated PLAN MODE workflow (`002_workflow/002-02_workflow-planning-mode.md`).
- Successfully updated core data security guidelines (`000_core/000-14_core-ai-data-security.md`).
- Successfully created new tech-specific rules for Next.js/Supabase (`004_tech-specific/004-00_tech-specific-next-js-supabase.md`), Tailwind CSS (`004_tech-specific/004-01_tech-specific-tailwind-css.md`), and Shadcn UI (`004_tech-specific/004-02_tech-specific-shadcn-ui.md`).
- Successfully created new patterns for structured research reports (`998_patterns/998-00_pattern-structured-research-report.md`), working backwards planning (`998_patterns/998-01_pattern-planning-working-backwards.md`), and fake CoT reasoning (`998_patterns/998-02_pattern-fake-cot.md`).

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- General patterns for communication styles (tone adaptation, personality, structure).
- General principles for effective tool usage (efficiency, error handling, specific scenarios).
- Structured planning methodologies (detailed steps, working backwards, CoT).
- Specific guidance for common web development technologies (Next.js/Supabase, Tailwind, Shadcn UI).
- Enhanced data security practices (sensitive data handling, database operations).
- Structured output patterns (reports, code).
