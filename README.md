# ClineAGI Project Template

This repository serves as a template for creating new code projects managed by the ClineAGI assistant. It provides a basic starting structure and is intended to be cloned by ClineAGI when a user initializes a new project.

## Usage with ClineAGI

When creating a new project using ClineAGI, the assistant will clone this repository into your `projects/` directory and set up a remote named `template-upstream` pointing back to this repository.

You can use this `template-upstream` remote to pull updates to the template structure or files if they are made in the future.

## Customization

You can fork this repository to create your own custom project templates. When creating a new project with ClineAGI, you can specify your forked template URL if needed (this functionality may require future rule enhancements).
